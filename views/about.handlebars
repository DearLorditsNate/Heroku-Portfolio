            Whether it is a website, application, or program, the things I build focus on their essence. I believe a project works
            best when it does what it’s supposed to in a simple, uncluttered way.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have over five years of experience in nonprofits building positive and genuine donor relationships through
            thoughtful, tactful, and empathic relationship management. I bring this same attention to detail and
            authentic
            communication to my web development.
            <br>
            <br>
            I’m a quick learner, a clear communicator, supportive and collaborative with my team, and a leader amongst
            my peers.
            As a web developer, I prioritize attention to detail and have a passion for building products that make
            users' lives
            better.
